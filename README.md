# fast-lu-decomposition
Exercise to optimize the decomposition of a matrix, which finds applications in
machine learning and scientific computing. Created as a term project for ITCS
4182 at UNCC.

## Guidance from professor:
 * Problem: Solve Ax = b.
 * Build two triangular matrices L and U such that A = LU.
 * Allows to solve Ax = b in O(n) time.
 * Algorithm is known (essentially what you saw in Linear Algebra) (Essentially
   Gaussâ€™ inversion)
