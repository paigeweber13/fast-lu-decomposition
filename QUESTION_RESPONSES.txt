This is a summary of responses to major questions. These are answered in more
detail in `fast-lu-decomp-presentation.pdf` and in the files found in 
`./experiments/plots`.

-performance model
  - for matrix of size n
  - 3n^2 flops
  - 2n^2 * (datatype size) bytes r/w
  - flop limit: 566 Giga-entries/second
  - entries/s mem limit: 8.5 Giga-entries/second

-what optimization on CPU were necessary
  - parallelizing
  - experimenting with schedules
  - experimenting with for loop placement
  - experimenting with chunk size

-How GPU implementation happens
  - Vince

-performance obtained and comparison to model
  - modeled: 8.5 Gigaentries/second
  - actual: between 0.5 Megaentries/second and 20 Megaentries/second
  - still about 2-3 orders of magnitude off
